## Tech Stack:
- Telegram for interface platform (Matthew Perkins). Telegram has a bot API called Telegram Bot, which allows for easy building of chatbots and choosing what functionaility you want to build for your chatbot. We will use the Telegram Bot API for basic interfacing with the user, and will integrate an AI model with Telegram Bot to allow for natural language to be used during a conversation.
